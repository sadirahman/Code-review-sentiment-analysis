Adding a storage util class in appDelegate may not be a good thing to do. Can you find an alternative? Maybe a constant class for them to read those data?
No. I didn't find any alternative. In Objective C it is not possible.
This description is not self explanatory.
Why is this case insensitive? In this case, "SASample://samsungaccount/callback", "Ssaample://samsungaccount/callback", "SASAMPLE://samsungaccount/callback" etc are all the same. What if someone outside SDK uses similar names using different letter combination? Please check.
Probably this is not necessary. You can test sending a nil value here.
NO, It is necessary. Because rangeOfSting() function return 9223372036854775807 when the searched string is not located in the provided string. But if the provided string is nil it return 0. So solution Is: whether it is used twice or used length() function. I think length() is safer because it also checks empty strings.
Because Server response URL is always in lower case but Url Scheme (used in initialization) can be a combination of lower case and upper case. That's why it should be check without considering the case.
Please check previous comment.
I see storage util is not imported here. Did you check if it works properly? It shouldn't work.
This title is too too too big. Please make it simple and to the point.

Please mention something like, "In order to identify Server Response, it is recommended that this substring is matched with the received URL string." - Or something smarter.
As NSNotFound is forcing you the implement one more condition checking, I would recommend you to consider other String based alternatives first.

"I wonder why Sang-Tai didn't define

That is a great question. For now I am just copying the usage of HeartWisePINInputView as in other places. In a future commit we can refactor to use a typedef such as HeartWisePinInputViewPtr
This is to prevent any child class from overriding or providing an alternative implementation for this function.
"If you make these methods in the base class final, why make them virtual?
If you look in ExercisingPageController, it defines this:
public:
	void Initialize();
	void DeInitialize();"
This is to prevent child classes from overriding or providing an implementation for. Actually, only a virtual method can be marked final as well.
"You are the first one to actually call InitializeImpl() in our whole project.
I see what you are doing here...
You are enforcing that the base class is not forgotten to be called, while allowing derived classes to reimplement InitializeImpl()"
That is correct. I feel it works pretty well!
Interesting how you demand InitializeImpl() to be implemented by derived classes, but not DeInitializeImpl(). Why is it? Looks not symmetrical.
I honestly went back and forth on this. After thinking over since my last commit I think it would be better practice not only for the symmetry but to help enforce that any engineers properly clean up the memory they have used. I will amend this commit to also require a DeInitializeImpl.
"I think we should formalize the initialization pattern you are pioneering here into an IInitializable interface with 5 methods and one bool that will have all the functionality you are adding here.

What do you think?"
I like this idea. I will create a new class in a future commit called Initializable with the all functionality surrounding init and deinit.
I think it would be great to move this method to the top after Initialize()
"Since this is a list of * and not Ptr, I wonder if this should be called mDiagnosticsPageControllers to show the difference.

Can you use UIWindow.WindowLower()? I had the same bug for one of the features I am working on and I found it worked very well to hide the page after the toast popup finishes. Let me know thanks!
Unfortunately, using UIWindow.WindowLower() does not fix this issue. I suppose you were referring to the use of UIWindow.WindowLower() in BluetoothDisconnectedViewController::OnToastPopupPoped(), but similar approach does not give the expected result on this case. Is there any known side-effect in the implementation given here? Thanks!
Ok that sounds good. I wasn't sure if it was the same case but if not then your approach works great!
As this is a definitive design decision I would prefer that we remove all of this code instead of commenting it.
We should remove this code instead of commenting.
Similar to my comment on DataSyncManager I think we need to refactor to have a base class in the future as this adds a lot of overhead to creating a new HTTP request and leaves room for human error when writing the code.
I think we need to create a new interface in the future like Requestable that we can pass to a function to call the Request function and increment mOutstandingRequests. For now I think this is great I just worry about the ability for any engineer to add a new request to the sync but forget to increate mOutstandingRequests.
I know this isn't introduced by you but we really need to refactor this function.
Yes, let's add it to our technical debt list.
Since you are doing UnRegisterAppPauseBroadCasterListener() in DeInitialize(), why also call it here?
Removed the call from DeInitialize as DeInitialize is not being called.
"I believe this method will also be called if you cover the watch with your hand. 
In which case you don't want to exit the app.

Do you want to add this code then:

			return;
		}"
Removed CancelExerciseAndExit() from here caz as previously it will be handled from HeartRateMeasuringView. Now no new operation is being given now no need to handle LCD condition.
Can we make a new method like CancelExerciseWithAppExit() and put these code there?
If you move new line 252 after new line 279, then new lines 257-268 could be replaced with one call to CancelExercise();
"This method is being called from some other places so I didnot want  to make any modification on this one. 

Also 267 and 268 need not to call on the other case except CancelExerciseAndExitApplication.

Anyway I understood your comment summery. You wanted to minimize the duplicacy of 257 to 265. I can modify both methods again along will all the places where those have been called."

Why does DiagnosticsPageControllerType have CONTROLLER_TYPE_ prefixes, but TransportType doesn't? Seems to be redundant.
Thats a good point the enum class name already scopes it to a controller type so I will remove the CONTROLLER_TYPE_ prefix.
I felt that a smart pointer is not needed as these pointers will never leave the scope of the DiagnosticsViewController. I can add deletes in the DiagnosticsViewController DeInitialize to provide proper memory clean up
Should I use this endpoint for verifyPin push notification validation?
No as it does not take an access token parameter and will not verify if the token we have is still valid.

Yes that is a good idea I agree. Going forward I will use IMSG_CHECK
I thought we were supposed to do either WindowLower() or AppExit(), but not both. Is this an incorrect assumption?
WindowLower hides the previous screen from flickering when the toast popup is animating away as the application is terminating. I would say it is an incorrect assumption as the two functions do entirely different things.
Should have "Ptr" at the end
"Do you mind renaming PINSuccessToastPopUp to PINSuccessToastPopup for consistency in this commit?

"Instead of having 3 methods HasConnectionStatusChanged(), IsConnected() and IsDisconnected(), why not just have one method GetConnectionStatus()? 
I think that type of API would be simpler to use..."
As mentioned in other comment as this is being persisted to the DB this is stored as an int. These are helpers functions defined in the API so anyone that uses this object doesn't have to do the comparisons themselves.
Why not use enum class for these?
This is stored in the database so int is the best choice.
Why not output on one line all 3 things?
Just personal preference
No need for virtual destructor for static Util class. Also should delete both constructor and destructor.
Why not just do OnConnectionStatusChanged() in Subscribe()?
As the function name suggests this is a way for an observer to get the most up to date data as well as any changes versus Subscribe which only gets future changes.
I don't see Health::DataTransportPtr dataTransportPtr used here.
I meant adding " = delete" instead of deleting from source code
I think you replied to the wrong comment but anyways I have added the = delete for GearConnectionUtil constructor and destructor. Thanks
Actually for us to define a static variable in GearConnectionUtil this needs to be a define otherwise it will cause a runtime crash.

Because all file logs also do DMSG.
If we cannot have server team support in 2.4 development cycle this solution seems to fix the issue.
"Patch Set 1:

In general we need to avoid file logs in the UI applications as well as LibCommon as LibCommon can potentially be executed in the UI application.

This was a mistake I made for example with the log I added to CoolDownViewController. So for now I think it is better to just remove all File logs from LibCommon / UI applications to solve the problem with many file log files being generated."
We should remove this actually. We need to develop a better solution for file logging in UI applications as this is done on the main thread.
I think the cost of doing a file log outweighs the downside of not being able to find bugs.

Regarding all of copied code comments (""I copied this code directly from shealth-gear"") I just wanted the API to work as it does in shealth-gear. If any of the code in VconfManager needs to be refactored into a cleaner way we can clean it in future commits."
Why do we need this extra layer? What does it give us in addition to VconfManager?
The vconfmanager has one static listener which can be set. Adding this object allows many other objects within our application stack to subscribe to the gear connection status. Also the vconfmanager is a very large object with many vconf settings so this provides an object whose one job is provide an API for info about the gear connection.

"Patch Set 1:

This was a mistaken merge. It should have gone to w/master, not master branch"
Can you clarify why this change was needed? Introducing this change implies the previous pedometer did not handle this case which is a big issue if so.
Yes, pedometer was not handling this scenario because it used to mark everything in table as Synced every time it synced data.  With new logic of paging our requests, having unsynced data from past is a possibility now.  So we have to first check if we have synced all data from past before we go on with current data.
"I see your point but I think this code introduces more problems unfortunately. If you follow the flow of execution if this has an unsynced data from more than 10 minutes ago it will ignore steps that it needs to generate. 

I think we need to rethink this implementation as now we are changing the pedometer code which is too large for 2.4. We need to go back to changing just the sending of the HTTP requests."
"As personal preference I like to avoid function calls in complex boolean expressions if you pull out the function call you can give the boolean a contextual name to provide info to other engineers reading the code.

Something like 

bool hasAnymoreDataToSend = UploadAllData();
if (!hasAnymoreDataToSend) {
    //notify listener sync is complete
}"
I think UploadAllData() should be moved into implementation of mDataSyncListener.OnSyncFinished(). Because maybe for some finished requests we don't want to have UploadAllData()
I think it needs to be here otherwise this object is incorrectly calling OnSyncFinished. If this object still has more data to upload we should not tell other objects that we are finished.
I would prefer to keep the code more verbose to have a function that checks the count of rows that are type pedometer and have sync flag as 0.
I think we need to remove the time_offset so our select and update can be mirrored.
"Do you have a reason to pass int as a ""const &"". Unless there's a reason, int is a preferred way to pass ints.
Also a lot of people don't like default parameters. I tend to agree with their reasoning."
As we are not supposed to modify page size unless extremely necessary, I made this a default here.  Now it is not needed for caller to know page size to make this call.  And it still provides flexibility of using different page size limit in case if it's really necessary to do so.
"Shouldn't this line be inside of if()?
Otherwise if you keep quickly pressing, the OnClick() will not happen."
Actually that is the whole point of the code. We only want to process one click per second.
If the user presses 10 times in 3 seconds, none of the clicks will be processed.
Do we want to do any work if there's no listener?
I think this is ok as they are two separate responsibilities. One to decide if a click has happened and another to try and tell another object a click has happened.
But if you quickly check for listener and there's none, none of the more expensive work needs to be done.
This usually goes into .cpp
As it's an empty constructor I prefer just to have it in the header file.
We have many empty constructors and they always, not usually, go into .cpp if they have an initialization list.
I am not sure what this has to do with my code? I put it here this way because this is personal preference as I mentioned in my previous comment.
strings don't need to be re-initialized with "". as default constructor does this already: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/string/

I think its better to remove this function. Anyways it is only 2 lines and doesn't make sense for a model to know how to save itself.
I don't think this is the best approach as this makes it possible to "lose" app errors. I think its better to send all up to a limit in order to ensure all errors are delivered.
We also put spaces around "!="
For a clean JSON structure we should not have this check. We need to always put the JSON array. If it happens to be empty then that lets us know there were no app errors.
Was this the reason for table not being created?
Yes, Query was incorrect.
I think it's better to have a select query with a limit instead of min and max time in order to not lose any errors.
I don't think this is the best place for this code as this will only happen once the HTTP payload is delivered. Once the app error has been transferred somewhere we should either delete it or mark it as synced. So it would be better to delete the app errors once inserted into a Heartbeat even in the heartbeat table.

"Patch Set 2:

I propose redesign of getting activity to be implemented in a separate commit(s).

I think for a happy middle ground you can check if there are any new Activity IDs in the list and if so add them to the ActivityDetailRequestHandler rather than blocking the 2nd request completely.
I think this definitely fixes the PLM but I don't like this solution. Because this is blindly blocking the next request we don't know if we are missing out on a new exercise. Imagine the user adds manual exercise as the sync job is running this will be possible to introduce a new PLM that manual exercise is not seen on the watch.
I would prefer commenting this line out and adding a comment why it was removed. So in the future this lane is not added back. But that could be just me.
I think anyways this code was originally copy and pasted so I think its better to leave deleted. It was my mistake to have put it here in the first place it is better for engineers to no how APIs work before using them.

"Patch Set 3:

I want to add that I was able to confirm that this is where PLM's crash was:

137        if(curHttpResponseDataPtr == NULL){
138            DMSG_ASSERT(""http response should not be null"");
139        }

I got it doing this:
heart_wise alex.bravo$ /Users/alex.bravo/tizen-studio/tools/arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc-4.9/bin/arm-linux-gnueabi-addr2line -Cfe ServiceHealth/Debug/heartwise-service 0xb7858

/Users/alex.bravo/health/heart_wise/LibCommon/src/NetworkUtil/NetworkProxy.cpp:138 (discriminator 5)"
I realized that just returning is not enough, as we will violate our guarantee that 100% of responses go to either ...Completed() or ...Failed()
Hmm this is a tough case to handle. Because if the requestDataPtr is null then we don't the request id so we can't find the correct response ptr.
I meant to say networkEventListener instead of response ptr :)
"We get here if Curl thread had a status THREAD_CURL_STATE_RESPONSE_COMPLETED, but no response data is present.
I think in this case we need to switch from calling OnHttpResponseCompleted() to OnHttpResponseFailed().
Jordan, what do you think?"
"On more investigation, we should not do this as this case is probably a result of HTTP_RESPONSE_CREATED = 201:
if(responseCode == HTTP_RESPONSE_SUCCESS || responseCode == HTTP_RESPONSE_CREATED){

which is still a success, just with no more data about it."
I think we need more time to investigate this issue. This ptr being null is  a very odd edge case which we need to better understand. I would say for now as a very small improvement lets change all ASSERT logs to a file log so we can have an understanding of how often this is happening. Or even better we can add an analytic or heartbeat data point as these logs are supposed to be extreme edge cases where the system is not working.
This is what this change does - changes to SERVER_LOG_ERR and doesn't crash. If you say it's an extreme edge case, then adding an analytics event is an overkill. Is there anything else I can do in this change?
To be clear I meant changing all ASSERT logs to be file logs. Meaning anywhere we have DMSG_ASSERT we have it in a file log.
There are 28 calls to DMSG_ASSERT which is a lot, and since ASSERT crashed and we didn't have to worry about what happens afterward, but now we would, the change you are proposing is not going to be easy. I feel like removing 2 places as done in this CR is a good start.

Regarding the UI change too it is actually more complicated than I originally anticipated because there are two different UI apps that have the WelcomeViewController so the logic is more difficult to implement."

It looks like you are changing the difinition of this class. It's supposed to be an Interface.
I wonder if we should also set mNumberOfIncorrectPinInputs to 0 in Initialize()
This should be a member variable in the header file. Should also rename to using m notation such as mNumberOfIncorrectPinInputs

I think with the limitation of WSViewController you cannot do it this way. You always need to have a root WSView for it to work correctly. I think just put the if pin is not required show the popup before you set the view otherwise just show the view. Then when you call the OnViewBack function everything will work properly.
"Good point.

It has actually grown on me. I like it now for all pointers. It serves as a reminder to dereference which is common between raw and smart pointers so I like it.

Instead of trying to insert and then check the size, would it be cleaner to find() if this element is already there and if not, both insert and render?
Both insert and find are logarithmic time complexity so it would not make sense to find and then insert as this would take twice as long.
The complexity is only a consideration only when you have a lot of items. We have right now 2 and maybe will add a few more in the future. The readability of the code is more important here IMHO.
If you are talking about execution performance then yes I agree but anyways I don't agree with the idea of finding something and then finding it again to insert or remove it.
"Same comment as above, kind of what code in this page does:
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/find/"
Why separate this line from previous? For symmetry? For line length? Not recommended in C++.
"Should new lines 281-286 go inside of RescheduleJobInfoPtr()?
Otherwise there's not much of ""Re"" in RescheduleJobInfoPtr()"
No actually the reschedule function works great because it is a way to schedule a job using an existing job. This is why it is named Reschedule.
The definition of "reschedule" is "change the time of (a planned event)." Which is different from "schedule one more time" in that "change" word. So I expect Reschedule to both cancel old and then schedule new.
As this was not the intention of the function I will use the overload approach as it is accomplishing the same thing just with different function parameters.
"It would be great to stop using this C practice of separating initialization from assignment.
In all the functions."
Yeah any storage code I implement is copied from previous storage objects. I think we need to change every single storage object as they all follow this format.
"Shouldn't this limit be connected somehow with the job batch size?
What happens to the remaining jobs?"
No actually this functions job is just to return a filtered list of jobs as the job size can grow very large. The job manager uses this function to reschedule jobs 25 at a time.

I do not agree with this refactoring as the old functionality of ChangeServerURL was very particular of things we do when we change the server URL. I do not think the feature for hard reset is the same.

2. Stop the service completely - service_app_exit_without_restart
3. Cancel all tizen alarms to ensure the service is not launched"

I thought I got rid of all these Successed words...
This is a new file created from an old branch so it is wrong here. Fixed in next patch.
I don't see this used here
Should we remove this method then if it's not used anymore?
It is a couple files to remove we can clean it up in a future commit
Is there a reason to have different value and name from the get go?
Yes as the constant value is given from the server but the variable name gives context to the client side of why we are using it.
Not a big deal, but all other requests are grouped together above
Did you not want to put this request into DataSyncManager?
I did not want this to be a part of the sync button behavior from Diagnostics.

For better maintenance, instead of hardcoded 4 it's better to use length 0f CLEAR_DATA_PASSWORD here.
Strangely, according to Tizen Coding style (#10.) case and switch should have the same indent.
I really dislike that I would prefer this style myself.
It's 2 tabs for initializer list
Can you provide an example? I cannot find any objects that use 2 tabs. All the classes I checked (randomly picked 5) use 1 tab. Thanks
"Point 13 in Tizen C++ Coding Rule states ""Constructor initializer with one indent"".
Yet we have 122 places in our code ""TABTAB:"", but most of them for inheritance. 
Looks like your way here is more correct."
The formatting of the inside of for() loop was actually correct before and now it's not.
I think actually the problem was the wrapping to next line. I have fixed that and reverted my change to the inside for loop indent.
"This is somewhat misleading. It sounds like DiagnosticsViewController is going to update UI here, but in reality its causing self-destruction.

"Why create a new DoServerSync method that has to be jumped over, remembered and maintained in a header if you use it only in one place?

Just following our set standard of having functions do one thing. DoServerSync is anyways replacing an old function we had which was a callback. I prefer having one functionality within one function similar to all of the other private functions inside ServerFeatureController.
Please use initializer list here
Actually use mCreateTime for all other objects.

Do you want to log this into your new JOB file?
Yeah good point would be good to have.
"Patch Set 3: Verified+1 -Code-Review

I addressed all the suggestions for improvements"
I think you should serialize into a plain model object instead of parsing the JSON each time a getter method is called.
This is good to act as a proxy for the actual setting storing the text value. But we also need a plain model object that has fields in memory for each of the possible configuration data. That way the database data can be moved into memory one time and any getter methods are just reading from memory and are not parsing JSON each time.
I'm making ClientConfig into that POCO and moving dealing with DB storage into ClientConfigManager.
I think these functions need to be wrapper functions for the actual object itself. We should not read from sqlite each time but instead read from sqlite into memory if the ptr is null. Otherwise just return the same function on the ptr.
Since we are using client secret server error handler should not be used.
"Client config request uses client secret. We should not check for authorized first. We need to render the customer service phone number for pin pair so we definitely need to call this API before pin pair.

Also this needs to be more robust in terms of when to call the API. We have found many patients that don't let their watch turn off so we need to move this to another system to periodically update the client config."
To make this a little "cleaner" you can use the empty function.
"What's the point of saving MIN_RPE in initialValue? 
mRPESelectionViewPtr->SetRPEValue(MIN_RPE) seems ok."
Wouldn't it be safer to set the initial value first and then close the popup? Because the value can be changed in the background by turning the bezel while the tip is visible; closing the tip before setting the value might make the wrong value show at first. Please check.
One case has not been covered in this solution. Currently, the tip goes away automatically sometimes when there is no user interaction for a long time (although according to UX the tip should stay there). So if the value was changed in the background then neither back nor OK button was pressed, the issue can be reproduced by not interacting with the watch in the current implementation.
We don't need to init Ptr to null. The other 2 Ptrs are not inited.
Since you have else below, why init this?
Personal preference. I understand why it's not needed though.
For my education, what is the advantage of having a style like this?
Setting a style for a TEXTBLOCK is different compared to TEXT. Since I changed it to a TEXTBLOCK to make it more dynamic to change from white text to red text I had to change the style setting in the edc as well.

What do you think about calling mPagePtr->StopLoadingAnimation();  here?
I have called mPagePtr->StopLoadingAnimation() at OnPageShown() function so It's not a major issue. However I will update it in my upcoming CL.

"That's an interesting idea.

I have emailed to Joo Bae about the difference between ""Not Connected"" under Bluetooth page and Internet access page. Joo Bae has explained the reason of using lowercase ""c"" in ""Not connected"" under bluetooth. His reply was:

The reason we differentiate the title and subtitle as title case and sentence case was to emphasis the titles, which is more dominant element, than subtitles.
 
•Bluetooth page 
•Title: Galaxy Watch
•Subtitle: Connected / Not connected
 
•Internet access page 
•Title: Connected / Not Connected  
•Subtitle: Bluetooth disconnected / No internet access on phone

If we change “Not connected” to “Not Connected” on Bluetooth page to make the message consistent, I would expect the change of Internet access page subtitle to be title case which wouldn’t be a good way to display information. So, I would suggest to refer the current UX spec, using title case for title and sentence case for subtitle. If you have any concerns from your side, please let know."

To remove an observer, the SGNetworkreachabilityMonitor class searches for that specific listener object by it's ID first. if it is available, it applies the remove operation. Otherwise it prints listener object-id not found.
It will be gr8 if you use some better name.
Is it fixed id? what is the purpose of this id ?
"Whenever a client starts an observer, it has to send a protocol object in the parameter to SGNetworkReachabilityMonitor class, and the class stores that object by an id. And returns the id to the client.

"According to iOS developer guide, Each call to this method is always preceded by a call to the tableView:dragSessionWillBegin: method. 
Did we implement tableView:dragSessionWillBegin: too? Also the logic to maintain the boolean variable ""needToLoadDraggedCell"" is not clear. On which tableview delegate methods we need to set the variable's value. How did you figure out this. What if we need to add a new tableview delegate? At that time, what should be the value of ""needToLoadDraggedCell""? Also, did you check, if cellForRowAtIndexPath is calling after each drag and drop without your change?
Lastly, is the issue root cause is properly identified?"
"Q. Did we implement tableView:dragSessionWillBegin: too?
Ans: No, we are not implementing this method because we have nothing to do during drag session began.If we implement then it will be called before.

Q. is the issue root cause is properly identified?
Ans: Before we need to know our problem scenario, that is when we drag a cell and scrolling down so that dragged cell's position is gone up, on that case the preview was not shown but if we again scrolling up with the dragged cell to it's previous position the preview is shown. When we leave the dragged cell during the case of not showing preview, the dragged cell is not updated and this is the issue.
Now the preview showing is handled by iOS. So we can not control it.  

Q.How did you figure out where ""needToLoadDraggedCell"" should be set?
Ans: For resolving this issue we need to update the specific dragged cell during the occurrence of this issue at the end of the drag session.

dragPreviewParametersForRowAtIndexPath this method is called when we drag the cell and leave the cell at a place where we will not drop it (if it is implemented ).
moveRowAtIndexPath is called when we successfully drop a cell.

After this two methods tableView:dragSessionDidEnd this method called.So we are setting false in this two methods. If the issue situation occur dragPreviewParametersForRowAtIndexPath this method will not be called so on that case we update the cell in tableView:dragSessionDidEnd method."
This method seems to get called on end of a drag. The table view should be reloaded on end of a drag. You can skip detecting to reload using needToLoadDragCell boolean. Please check.

"Patch Set 5: Code-Review+1

New Check item:
1. project file changes."
is it necessary to be static... create instance of capability store and then use it. when instance will be garbage collected then memory will be freed.
is it necessary to be static? it seems not need to be single shared instance. it can be initiated and then use.
this class will use only back end, any other class will not use, also no need to create any other instance. only if user change the phone local time this class will send current time information to moden
"This function may call several times. So add observer will be also called several times. So that time may be you will get the notification multiple times. 

Ref link :
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7751191/how-to-stop-the-observer-in-nsnotification-to-called-twice"
For future debug purpose need to print this dictionary value.
This is optional type. So i think need to give default value if value is nil.
please check is it call one time or more than one time for any settings change
Unnecessary change.
epoch time should be sec, Please  remove this multiplication
"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

Check item:
is_initial_watch parameter value is changed for moden."
Why this appLog contain name "junaid"?
Which tips card call? Please give meaningful log.
"remove this type of text ""we are... "" 
instead wearable will send the required widget valid IDs
or better text."
"AppIconPath naming seems like path to physical storage. But here we are using resource name as icon. 

Suggesting name to DefaultAppIcon instead of AppIconPath"
Rename it to MessageAppIcon
Are Phone and SMS only defaults apps?
We are considering this two apps for now. It will be discussed later for other apps.
Appname is Message. Please rename it to message_bundle_id
You can use artifact_path to save derived data. Project root should remain intact. Moreover, our git configuration ignore output path for indexing.
"is not OOBE and reconnection steps different? it is always calling OOBE next steps. then how it will work in reconnection scenario.
Please, test all the OOBE and reconnection scenarios to ensure it is working correctly."
"initial capex message are same and end didReceiveInitSettingsResponse we have make a decision based on connection and reconnection

if isReconnectingModen then we post only notification otherwise call processNextStep

OOBE and reconnection step working fine"
"Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1

Checked Item:
1. accesstoken nil value and validity check."
"Patch Set 5: Code-Review+1

Checked items :
1. Add new init methods to handle new error types. (User try to add alarm on same time)
2. Change variable name."
Can use CamelCase convention.
You can make it AlarmDate.
Can use CamelCase Convension for static let type constant.
Please give a comment about when this init method need to  be used.
I think you can remove this line or can print the dictionary in this line.
NSInteger is defined in ruction definition in other file. But primitive data type Int is used. Both should be same. Please check.
"nsinteger is automatically bridged to Integer from objective c to swift
and it is suggestion given by xcode"
What does this right button represent? It should have a proper name.
"tips card might have different types of button,
So to identify properly, bottom Right Btn has been introduced.
if there is another button, then it should bottom left button"
Please give a proper button name. It can be like didTipsCardActionBtnPressed. Also, can we print the Tips card name based on the tag we get?
Please name it as actionButton.
"Patch Set 1:

I already submitted CL to resolve this issue. Did you find any problem there?"
Please mention in log that, this is for RTL case. Otherwise it will look same for LTR case as well.
These 3 lines are not needed as you put them in else part later. Please remove these lines.
it should be better to give ui reference about how  this maximum alarm count is taken
It is supposed to take from UI reference. Do you really think that we should give UI reference for all the integral constants from UI?
log should be added here
I added log here. Please check.
"Every module should have a class for localization text.
so that, the one who will apply DID will check only one place but not whole class to find out DID"
"If it is a requirement to create a class to contain all the texts, I will implement it.

I think, we should not consume memory for all this static texts twice."
add a log after replacing spacial chars.
if this class is solely responsible for TipsCard weather provider, then rename it as SGTipsCardWeatherProvider or SGTipsCardWeatherManager or better name.
"This is not solely responsible for TipsCard. Already ayub vai have  given  suggestion regarding this and suggest us to give name. 
So not want to change this name."
why this is static, since these are private constant values so it can be instance type. if Provider class is static instance then all values will be load once.
please use SGAppLog method.
"So many function regarding log.

Ok i will change as SGAppLog."
use SGAppLog
plz, use weatherstore class for this use defaults wrapper.
please, create separate parser file and put it there.
This part is added by mahmud.  I will request him to make a separate file for this.
it may be rename as SGTipsCardWeatherInstallationHandler
"This class may handle some other functionaly other than only installation. So i think we can keep this name.

We have also plan to introduce a installer class which can handle all types installation from diffent module."
you may use WearableManagerService class instead of SAP directly.
This will use to send file. SGWearableManagerService have no method to send file.
SGNetworkReachabilityMonitor this classs can be use for any network related info
SGNetworkReachabilityMonitor is not well tested till now. So i prefer current apple rechability.
only DispatchQueue.main.async block , within  DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background).async this code block. Is it necessary DispatchQueue.global?
"For current case we can ignore background thread. But if we need network related task then we need to do those in background thread.

Ref link :
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37805885/how-to-create-dispatch-queue-in-swift-3"
if it is necessary in future, then keep it code snippet  in commented block. and just use the necessary code now.
"there have a card that will be show if  if have any update May we can check  only here 
SGUtils.isConnectedWithNetwork()"
"Auto update should be available if user ON FOTA AUTO update and Device connected with Wi-FI
add another check with user default value that appear from IS_FOTA_AUTO_UPDATE_ENABLE  Key"
what happen if it is find there is update? any response handler is necessary?
if  found any update, respective class will start update after check some precondition. response will handle that class
is this constant necessary for any other feature? if not then define it in Fota specific class
please, use self...
if it is instance variable please use self.  except for local variables
please, do not use Alamofire directly. if necessary use HttpCommunicationProtocol and SGAlamofireAdapter... class
why do this is required here ?
Alamofire is used to check network reachability status.
in if condition how it works, to set ?? false as default value. break down code in separate simple logic to assign value first and then use in if condition
no use usedefaults directly... use store class as wrapper API
"1. Don't use _ in the name.
2. Please make a store class for that and give api which will use from both UI and here. Others class shouldn't know about internal userDefaults key."
KISS: keep it simple and stupid is sometimes more readable code. do not need to be  clumsy inline code. this smart code is not readable and maintainable as well as for debugging and bug fixing.
It should be suota.
Could add a else block here and print log? It will help to know if response is not coming for any specific class.
I think we no need. We have log already.
Duplicate code block. Just add " cell.cellType = cellHeaderViewTypePowerSaverOn" in the existing else block.
Device disconnection scenario need so
Duplicate code block.
"Patch Set 3:

moden binary has some problem, please don't merge this cl before 100% testing"
is it static function? why need sgwidget store static functions. it should be instantiated and then use to call func.
"In SGWidgetStore Constructor we initialized 4 maps

self.initializeModenWidgetNameMap()
self.initializeModenLiteWidgetNameMap()
self.initializeModenWidgetImagePathMap()
self.initializeModenLiteWidgetImagePathMap()

but when we want to save Ordered Widget List, then we don't need to initialize these maps because we are not using these maps while saving the widget data,  we only saves the widget_id & widget_order, they are provided by the functions parameter. So I think we shouldn't initialize an object of SGWidgetStore rather I made the function static (class method) to ignore executing unnecessary codes."
"it seems to me that this init function is doing what it should not be. this block of code should be refactored to better another way.  
init should not be instantiate other class interanlly and then use that."
please, add log what is save.
why it is needed connected device type here. is not possible without app with new enum. (SGUtils.isGalaxyFitDevice()) can be used keeping in a variable.
Yes, vai, I will update this in next CL.
"Patch Set 1: Verified+1

Searched for DID for band.
if it is found, applied it.
if it is not found , replaced the existing ""Gear"" text with ""Band"" as in all of the localisation file ""Gear"" has been written in English"
Please remove this lines. This may create ambiguous scenario. Support you connect with a Galaxy Fit. Now from Connect New Gear, tap on a Gear Fit2 Pro to connect. The soup with show "Connect with Band". So Remove it.
Remove these lines.
Please keep existing change. We need to show a generic message during Connecting and Pairing
Please. keep previous change.
Some extra changes can be remove, those are not relevant with current CL.
Can we log different values of the calculation?
We should not print log here as this method will invoked many times for a scroll attempt. I used the offset value that the collection view is providing. Did not make any calculation on it.
please add s.
this line should be included into SGUtils.isConnectedWithNetwork()
Please change the protocol name like SGSuotaServerFirmwareDownloadResponseProtocol
It will be changed in next CL.
Both side padding 60 or 90 ?
"90/3 = 30
and both side is 30 + 30 = 60"
Please use AppLog
initializeVariable method is called again before calling requestBatteryInfo. Please check properly, if initializeVariable method actually needs to be called.
Make it string by providing "value"
"Please share more details about refactoring in this commit message
1. What is the purpose of refactor?
2. Which functions/code are refactored?
3. How did you test the changed code?"
"Commit message has been updated.
1. SGAppManager class became too large and convoluted. It was also serving multiple purposes. Hence refactoring into multiple classes was required. 
2. Featured app related codes were refactored and re-written into swift.
3. Test is ongoing, with Log/Debug and manual checking. Unit testing was not written yet."
Can you check if text alignment set as Natural
"Already the text alignment is set to natural.but
it's not working by setting text alignment natural."
"Patch Set 1:

(2 comments)

Please add logs in Alarm feature. there are few logs at present."
Please put log here.
Is this condition needed? Please check.
"as result is any object, we must convert it into boolean.
The let statement will avoid any crash if it fails to convert.

But as the result field will have a value for share, we can omit this check.
In that case we will have to force wrap this value."
"Patch Set 1:

AlamofireHttpAdapter is not the part of this CLs and commit message does not match. please give separate CLs for this."
"Patch Set 1:

(1 comment)

I mentioned HTTP Manager crash in cause & measure ""Fixed an HTTP Manager crash issue occurred if host name is invalid.""

This crash occur only when notification service request app icon with invalid name."
Please remove that in next CL.
Return sorted list by name quote is true. Thats why i didn't removed that comment.
Please give proper try catch check in this function.
I think this check is not sufficient. We already have checked that if we give value 0 for responseDict[SGNotificationsParams.AppName] than it creates crash. But you didn't give that check here.
"Patch Set 3: Verified+1 Code-Review+1

Checked Item:
utils method to convert weather icon number for 4 CP types."
Please remove City word.
ok removing "City" from name
please make it Cold.
You can name this as "convertedIconNumber"
"Remove city word.

You can name this ""convertedIconNumber"""
Here you should also add 45.
Forgot to add.
Please add 46 also.
This part should be Cold.
Please remove that part. This is unnecessary.
It should be Cold.
removing this unnecessary code lines
Please give a space. It will increase readability.
"plz, move this function in each provider class. it is not util function.
this icon mapping is specific to content provider."
ok I am moving each IconNumber converter to specific content provider.
You should use "CamelCase" for "static let" data field naming
if it is same function as in OOBE initsync msg, you may create a util function and use that.
Same function as in OOBE.Will create a util function and  Update in next CL
Equality operator (==), returns true for operands whose values are equal. Here do we need to assign "true" to smartCardActivation and then return. Or, it is needed to put equality operator here? Please check.
We don't need to assign any value to smartCardActivation variable. Just need decision true or false.
"Patch Set 1: Verified+1 Code-Review+1

This lib contains weather module new field."
"very confusing name.
just case name is changed, no decision was made though"
This method for increasing readability  only
should be an else part of showing log
"This menu will only show for LTE model. This condition should be like 
if !SGUtils.isBTModel() {
    //show Call Forwarding page
}"
"log should be added
and again
is it possible to use guard instead of long if block???"
No, aboutGearCardcell is not optional. Xcode suggests to do like this.
"is it possible to use guard block?
or if let block???"
Please use SGLogger.log()
It can't be accessed by this project and needs to updated as dev_gearfit
Please use SGLogger.log() and put meaningful text. For example, the log text "isPermissionTaken" doesn't match with the actual function name. Please check.
SGLogger can't be accessed by this project and needs to updated as dev_gearfit
Please put log here to write "gearId"
In the else part have no code. So I think its better to remove this part.
"Reset Failure" log should be added.
change this name to iOS convention such as didReceiveDeviceDisconnect or didDisconnectDevice or better names.
no need to multiply as it is 0
"What's the reason to call removal(). The dictionary of array is just created. 
Could you try to apply following codes for diclaration;
var DictArray = [[String: Any]()] 
or,
var DictArray = [Dictionary<String, Any>()]"
Create a separate function to create this XML file.
As per decision with HQ, we should use list icon. Please check.
"Patch Set 1: Verified+1

pls unComment the comment line in comment out upper code in
moveToTermsAndCondition function"
"Patch Set 1:

(2 comments)

I suggest to add more logs in important places"
"1. Class name should start with SG prefix
2. Give a Meaningful class name."
"This is a third party library.
Later on, it will be moved under pod."
SG prefix should be added before class name. Please change it.
what is the reason of such comment?
"To reveal new Terms and Condition page.
When, SGInitSequence is ready, then it will be opened and upper portion of the code will be removed"
Class variables should be at top, just after class declaration for readability.
On top of this variable, those are all variable either computed or type.
Please print the function name as well.
This funciton will automatically print function name, because under this, DDLogVerbose has been called
Unnecessary log print. Please check.
As "override func updateViewConstraints()" is handled by iOS , I think using of  it is more better.
"according to apple doc,
You should only override this method when changing constraints in place is too slow, or when a view is producing a number of redundant changes.
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller/1621379-updateviewconstraints"
Use applog instead of print
Unnecessary space. Please check.
Insufficient space between functions.
"Logic from line 23 to 33 doesn't match with requirement. 
1. EULA and Privacy Policy are required now.
2. There can be 1 option
3. There can be 2 options
4. There can be >2 options.

Please check."
Unnecessary space/line break in this file. Please check.
This new function has no definition. Please check.
Better to use variable for derived path instead of hard coded path.
Please check if viewWillAppear need this method?
What is part 2?
Previously a CL with same name and purpose was given.
In these methods, every time quickSettingsListFromGear this array is empty and again filling. It seems it is a costly operation for many elements. Can you use any other alternative way?
"Maintaining the array is the main concern here to update the table view 
Emptying and filling the array are mandatory to calculate the number of section.
I'll try to optimise the logic in the next CL."
Why you need to declare it as static? And how you requesting for quick settings?
"There should be only one array list of quick settings otherwise it would create confusion.
Its getting updated when quick settings are changed in gear side.But then the data  in the UI side is not getting updated. Thats why it should be static."
As this change is not related to UI side so you can inform exact person of backend for applying better solution.
The source code change does not match with CL description. Please check if CL description is correct
Remove pulse word. This feature is generic for watch devices.
Please change function name. Remove pulse word. Put more generic word.
Put meaningful log inside function.
"1. Avoid using magic numbers. Can we ""let""/""#define"" this number. 
2. can we use .round(.up) as ceil function. Please check."

I think, this part should not be in Manager. It should be passed between views via presenter->wireframe/other navigation ways, and forward view should request detail data for that contact.
Redundant code, as optional value will be nil by default.
this callback won't be necessary.
May be method name spelling mistake

Can a feed not have a Group? I think feeds must have a group according to our current UX.

Better to rename it as "SocialNotification" only.
"I'd recommend to update view with myProfile data at first.

Because, If we fail to get MyProfile data, this view will get Poped-out . in that scenario, fetching other calculation and retrieved data will be redundant."
Do not use raw value. I'd recommend to utilize the SocialNotification enum.
"As discussed, We don't need the variable in the viewController.
We can use the variable exist in the presenter.

Please check."
This seems redundant to me as these values are all type of notifications.
It seems these are not necessary, enum names will be enough.
This is also not necessary as discussed.
"Let's use another wrapper for notification centres.
We may use different centres for different purposes instead of using default."
let's add notification util methods from the wrappers to control notification messages centrally.
Let's discuss tomorrow if we can find a better way to handle these.

@IBDesignable annotation is better put on a separate line before class declaration for readability
"add animatedImage and any other property of FLanimatedimage as properties of this class with getter setter and then set those into FLAnimatedImage.
This is to make sure that if we need to change this library, we can handle the attribute changes just by changing this class"
It seems like you have added this in Common folder instead of common views. Clearly SAnimatedImage and SAnimatedImageView is referring to a view and is also defined as IBDesignable and as such should be placed in common views in my opinion.
please avoid force casting
This code is required. needed to reveres the change.

To update profile in server you can just make an async call right?
If you really have to make a sync call then use separate queue, not global queue, like this:

    DispatchQueue.main.sync {
        // update UI
    }

you can use global queue instead of main queue since it can be a background task. Right?

why is this line commented?
This function is deprecated. This was for Navid's test call which sends array of dictionary. Now we send array of object and convert it to dictionary in syncManager side.  So syncManager.sendScoreData has changed.
Why are you using return instead of break?
There was some common code outside of switch-case block that should not execute for this case. So "return" used here instead of "break".

team/health/iosSHealth / Codes/SHealth/SHealth/Tracker/Sports/UI/View/Split/SHTSportSplitView.h

Please read the comments and fix if necessary."
"both" is plural. so it should be "values"
"MODE" is unnecessary.
"PATH" is unnecessary.
"Preferences" or"Shared Preferences" is an Android based term. We would like to use "User defaults" or "NSUserDefaults" here.
"some" is plural, so this should be "problems"
"special type of variables" is not self explanatory. Maybe using something like "special values like appID, appSecret, etc." would be better.
"that eliminates" or "that can eliminate" should be used here. Please check.
I am not sure if "USER" should be mentioned here. Please check and explain.
"top calls" is not the proper explanation here. Maybe you could use "previous calling hierarchy"
"(1) For general strings, we can use string.length to determine validity. For strings that may contain white spaces or similar unacceptable white space situations, we are using a macro that can eliminate the white spaces and check for validity.
(2) Solved by using switch/case statement to ensure performance."
"(1) isValidForType - this function is checking validity for standard NSString values, which is unnecessary. It should be aimed for special cases (CodeVerifier, AppID, etc.) only.
(2) isValidForType - function uses if/else chain which is a performance issue."
.A short description of "special type" would be useful to understand this. Please check
@Mostofa: I think no description is needed here. This is just basic operation.
"1. Are we sure that iv and key needs to be verified here?
2. Is queryDict not needed to check here?
Please mention in a comment which is needed and which is not in a comment and create a new task to check if proper validation applied throughout the project."
For Objective-C, it SHOULD be NO/YES. And please be very specific whether to use bool or BOOL in Objective-C platform.
Please change it to, "Invalid parameter type for length check is detected" and it should be SADebug.
Please keep a one line gap.
Can we keep it in a Macro?
I am not entirely sure if you should remove these. Please consult with PL.
Can we use a macro instead?
"1. Full names are used. May we apply naming convention in another CL?

2. The values are added."
"1. I think ""urlProtocol"" would be more suitable here.

"1. It is recommended to transfer this Macro definition in SAUtil file. Probably putting it in the *.h file will do.
3. Maybe we need to rename ""X"""
"1. Naming convention maybe done in another CL.
2. Done."
"1. Please use consistent naming convention. 
2. Please also mention the values in comment."
"1. Please use consistent naming. Like. they should be written like, ""SA_SDK_STAGING_1_SERVER_URL_AUTH"" etc.
2. Please also mention the values in comment."
1. Sure. No problem. But create a task first so that you don't forget later.
A short description of "special type" would be easier to understand what this means. Please check.
and "for" SWIFT applicaton, ...
Are they still valid? And do they not require renaming if valid?
Are we absolutely sure that this class needs to be imported here? Did we check if it is already imported in a parent class or already imported class? Please check and let me know verbally
Are you certain that key and iv values are required to be verified here?
Are you certain that key and publicKeyStr values are required to be verified here?
As isValidForType is completely removed now, this needs be changed as well.
As it is base case I will not recommend to add here....Please use it in the respective class
As per discussion with PL, either change this class to SWIFT or don't detach the functionalities from SAUtil class.
"1) yes.Both iv and key needs to be verified here.
2) No, queryDict will not empty here.
Thanks. Added"
As this is a special type, we should either use the isValidForType with added functionality or simply remove the isValidForType if not required at all. Please make necessary changes according to discussion.
can we check key and IV value before calling this function?
Can we define it in a macro instead of writing the whole thing every time?
"Can we do like
1. Before calling this function we can check as below
 -> if (SAMacroGetLength(value) > 0) called this function
      else show SAlogDebug

As a result we called that function at a minimum level....Well this is my suggestion...."
cancels*, please correct.
Cannot find the required change. Please recheck.
Changed to SA_SERVER.....
Checked and removed, no issues found after removing this.
checkSDKInit should be instance method
Description should be updated accordingly.
Did you check that if the same conditions are now applied for both our sample applications? And did you test in both SSO and non-SSO mode using both applications at the same time?
Didn't we previously agree that all staging mode items and production mode items are to be grouped together sequentially?
Doesn't actually explain why it is needed or what kind of refactor.
Doesn't define how to. Maybe you can use, "...changing this ENUM type parameter".
Double asterisk should not be used here.
First character of line should be started with capital letter.
For related calls, please find out why ivValue is not validated anywhere.
for single line conditional statements, maybe we do not need spacing.
getEntryPoint should be instance method
How about "contains the provided NSString value"
How about using "macro definitions" instead?
I am not sure why you chose the negative instead of the regular. Meaning, I would just write it as "isHTTPSupported". For HTTPS, it would return NO. Can you please mention if you did it only to avoid the "SS" situation?
"I am pretty sure this creates circular dependency. Here are my suggestions to avoid this problem:
1. You can create a new class for singleton variables only (as used in SAUtil class) and import from there.
2. You can put this variable in NSUserDefaults, which will also be persistent. But, your access logic is implemented in SAManager class. So this might be difficult as well.
3. Consult with our architect guy (PL) on what can be done.
4. (I have already consulted with the PL) Talk to me first. Or instead of importing SAUtil here, you can make the decision in previous stage and use the body dictionary to transfer the decision here. Then, you can utilise that."
I believe this description needs be updated. Also, you should use UL/LI tags as there is a list.
I believe, "any" is more suitable here.
I cannot find any application of constant here, can you please explain why this tag is used?
I don't think checking should be lengthy here, because you have to test the application thoroughly every time before a commit. However, we cannot allow hardcoded strings in a current CL. Please fix. However, you can replace only this places in this CL. And the rest later.
I shall do this in next CL as debugging now would be very lengthy.
I think "supported" is the word you are looking for. And the comments you described says so as well.
I think checking initialisation flow explains the situation better.
I think code format is not applied here. Can you please recheck using "ctrl+I" here?
Please check, this should be removed if you remove or alter the newly created class.
I think SERVER is more suitable here. We are not setting this from the SDK.
I think this information is obsolete now.
I think this is not necessary. Maybe mentioning something like, "Sample applications removing information in failed Sign out attempt which will cause sign in failure and some UI changes" will do fine.
I think we do not need a class function here
I think you meant "provided", not "specified"
I tired to use convention of paragraph title.
I tried to use convention of paragraph title.
I used because it was const integer value. Since we have no option to modify it inside the macro, it should not mention here. Thanks, changed.
I would recommend to rename the variable sporting both app id and client id.
If this is no longer used, please remove all references. But please run a thorough testing before committing again.
If we are not using it anymore, we should remove it.
Is there any specific reason as to why this entire line is in new line? Maybe line break is advisable, or you could use @Note or similar tags.
Is this valid for all data types?
It indicates that this functionality was available some other way before and now it is implemented via initialisation API. But as far as I understand, there was no functionality before for this. Please check.
It is declared only for strings. For NSData we have to calculate length directly
It should be double asterisk.
It should be samples. please check.
Just "Initialization flow" is fine.
Let's describe it as "API"
Macro definition SHOULD BE and MUST BE after import calls.
Made it positive as per your suggestion. Now this is, "isHTTPSupported".
May I do this in another CL? Checking would be very lengthy here.
May we do the renaming procedure in a separate CL?
Maybe "fixedLength" is more appropriate here.
Maybe "in" is more usable here.
Maybe using "regular" is more suitable instead.
Maybe we can use pragma mark from now on. That is more convenient.
Maybe we should use the term "validated"
No description is provided here. Please check.
No,It is valid for only String. Updated.
Not "specified", it should be "provided"
Objective-C and SWIFT applications should be more appropriate.
Please also mention in comment why this is the only functionality with an exception of having this variable of all the REST APIs as well.
Please also mention on top of the function documentation why this function is commented out and replaced by which.
Please apply "ctril+I"
Please apply "ctrl+i"
"1. Can you please fix this spelling mistake? Thanks.
2. Also, as our development flow is updated many times, can you please verify if the description here is still valid and usable?"
"1) Thanks, Fixed.
2)Thanks. I verified. The description is still valid and usable."

`a list of string to be marked as unread`, yet this is named as `setNoticeAsRead`. Please clarify what you meant here.
Why some are `fileprivate` while some other variables are `private`?
Please try to make consistent names for Keys. `newNoticeKey` follows a camel case like structure, while `howToUseKey` follows a structure consisting of only Capital letters.
"Usage is confusing here, if `asRead` is true, does that mean that it's not been read or the other way around.

I would recommend renaming to something proper."
"What is this intended for? Did you know the `MutableProperty` has a producer/signal that you can access and use the operators to throttle the values off of, that will only throttle the reads though.

It looks like you are trying to throttle the writes to a backing property? What's the intended use case?

Also, something core like this should have some strong unit tests associated with it as well."
"According to the [documentation](http://reactivecocoa.io/reactiveswift/docs/latest/Classes/Signal.html#/s:13ReactiveSwift6SignalC8throttleACyxq_GSd_AA13DateScheduler_p2ontF) of `throttle(_:on:)`

> Forward the _**latest value**_ on scheduler after at least interval seconds have
> passed since the returned signal last sent a value.
We need all the values, set during the throttle duration rather than the latest.

Example

```swift
updatedLocationIDs = MutablePrioperty<[String]>([])
```
Now it is possible that `updatedLocationIDs` be updated like following, during the throttle duration:

```swift
updatedLocationIDs.value = [""locA"", ""locB""]
updatedLocationIDs.value = [""locD""]
```
The result should be like `[""locA"", ""locB"", ""locD""]` rather than this: `[""locD""]`

I think the placement of the file in Project directory & naming may have created
the confusion. If that's the case I will update.

This is a very special case, not something 'core'. And I am still open to suggestion for any better approach for the 'Example' case.

About Unit test, I will add."

I would recommend adding the initial TV devices from the `VisualContentPopulator`
Could you check if we get all the devices from the initial fetch? This would be the call in `VisualContentPopulator.setAllTVdevices` If we get it, then this adding call won't be required.
According to the logs, we are getting update events for TVs that aren't added yet. So, we can say `VisualContentPopulator.setAllTVdevices()` doesn't fetch all TV devices initially.
"How about changing the function params like following -

`addVisualContentCardsForRoom(locationID: String, roomID: String = ""default"", tvDevices: [VisualContentCardInteractorTVData])`

Then `addVisualContentCardsForLocation` won't be required.

Also, I think changing the function name to `addVisualContentCard(forLocationId locationID: String, forRoomId roomID: String = ""default"", tvDevices: [VisualContentCardInteractorTVData])` would be better."
Can `addVisualContentCardsForRoom` function be re-used here?
"like the addVisualContentCardForLocation, change the func name and param to

`deleteVisualContentCard(forLocationId locationID: String, forRoomId roomID: String = ""default"", forDeviceIDs: deviceIDs = [])`

So, if the call is made only with locationID, delete all devices under that location, same for room. If deviceIDs are mentioned, delete specific devices only."
"why need the `default` room?

if there is the add event of location, you can get the room list of the location

e.g.
`LocationContext.shared.getLocation(id: locationId).rooms`"
"Currently we store device data at `location:room`. So, if we get devices for a location where there are no rooms yet, what to do? Or, this is an invalid scenario? We need to be sure.

We thought this scenario may happen, so we added the `default` room where, just for storing the device data."
"if there are no rooms, please don't consider the tv devices of the location

we can add the tv devices when receive the add event of rooms"
I understand about the no room case. But suppose we have multiple rooms, which room we will select then? Is any api available which will provide `roomID` by taking `deviceID`?
"need to check the firmCode & locCode whether it is changed even if there is deviceId in the `visualContentIDCollection`

to check the firmCode & locCode, we need to use the `CloudDeviceManager.shared.getCloudDevice(deviceID)?.firmCode` & `.locCode` because the BeyondDeviceDataSource is not ready (the devices team will support the firmCode & locCode in after M1)"
Please check `updateAdditionalTVData()` at `VisualContentDS`. Calling this function will work, right?
"you can get the room list of the added location

and can get the tvDevices using the room list

```
for room list {
let tvDevices = self.interactor.getTVDevices(forRoomId: room.id)

Fixes https://smartthings.atlassian.net/browse/ONEAPP-9308
Can you help me understand the reason for this change?
Sometimes `authenticationStateProvider.authenticationState == .authenticated` check fails on cloudSignUp api as it is not updated, because `.cloudAccessStatusChanged` notification is not delivered yet. So for cloudSignUp case, we are using Keychain to check the availability of required data.
"The problem with this change is that it is moving us **away** from single-source-of-truth.

It sounds like there's a race condition where the `cloudSignIn` method is getting called before the `.cloudAccessStatusChanged` notification is being posted, is that right? What class/method is calling `cloudSignIn` before the `.cloudAccessStatusChanged` notification is being posted?

Are there other any other changes that we could make which would remove the necessity of performing this check?"
"This is a short-term temprorary solution because of authenticated posting can be slower than cloudSignUp/cloudSignIn.
It need to be refactored to use authenticationState again and change the authenticate posting logic later."
Same here. Can you help me understand the reason for this?
Is there a case that use the old saved verifier code? which means get accessToken without get new authcode?
"Removed codeVerifier update from this MR. Only Sign In Issue.

I just noticed that this is added to SmartFoundation.  It should not be IMO.  It should go into One App and should eventually be replaced with something better.  `NSError` is legacy and we should move away from it.

"not required, I think, we are already throttling:

Correct `swiftlint`
Dev team changes!  Please revert those.
If we don't need to import this stuff you should remove it.
Please don't use hard coded string "samsung"
Catalog api returns only the english localized string as category name for now, so we have no choice but to use hard coded string. If any localized string is used, then there is a chance that it will misbehave once the language is changed.
is this function accessed from anywhere? If not I'd recommend it to be private.
you can pass the `text` here directly as you've already checked whether or not it is nil.
canceled the automatic merge
we had a UI design with image https://zpl.io/aw1GRk7 for that alert, was it changed? at the same time existing code from `SmartSetupViewController` has same alert without image too.
Yes it is changed and to be similar I'm using the same alert which is used for adding a device.
as I remember we've found that same alert and strings are used inside `SmartSetupViewController:930`, can you replace not localised strings in that file too?
I temporarily added localization strings, but I think Hq developers will localize the strings in all languages and they can be used. These strings I'm using are only in english.
`maybeError` is not used and can be replaced with `_`
we need this to production/1.6.25 as well
you should make private init for singleton or else this static let doesn't make sense.
Doesn't the feature block this? Is this a valid comment with the feature flag?
Feature flag can(should) block Instabug popup :-). So, second like of comment here is just like information kind that blank appID also disables Instabug. But I think its redundant, will remove second line of comment here with rebase!
"Shouldn't you to capture the disposable and manually manage it since it looks like `setupBindings` could be called multiple times at different phases and would result in having many observations from auth to this state change?

Maybe not a disposable but a subContext.

I mention this cause the feature should go from true to false and you'd still have the observation wired up, but you would want to shut it down."
@kyle.leneau Based on Instabug's recommendation I am controlling enability of Instabug with its invocation method instead of setup again. So, I am calling `setupBindings` method only once (per app run cycle). It will still continue to observe auth state c
How do you deal with stopping this observation when the feature changes to off remotely?
If the feature starts with being on and then turns off and then this observation fires this will show the prompt again (for a feature that should be off), this will be a bug then in some situations.
"@kyle.leneau Yes, sounds like I need to wrap after delay line as,
`            onMainAfter(after: delay) {
                if FeatureManager.boolValue(of: .feedbackReporting) {
                    Instabug.showWelcomeMessage(with: .live)
             "
if `feedbackReporting` is false do we need to do `Instabug.logOut()`??
May be not, because in that case we are disabling Instabug anyways, and would let auth state changes/initial value to control Instabug.logout()
you need to make sure if user is authenticated and feature is on again before showing welcome message
There may be change needed here as per @kyle.leneau's prev. comment, but not for re-check on authentication because we want to show popup even if it's logged out mode. (Just don't want to show it at the start-up before login, and in here it would have only come when auth was logged in)
looks like you need to read this `AppConfiguration.shared.instabugAppId` from plist file??
Yes, it is already reading from plist file!
you could infact convert this to a `SafeSignalProducer` and then use `startWithResult` operator
I think you need to use here `strongSelf` reference.
"Since it's Singleton instance this won't deallocated in it's app lifecycle
You may not need this line"
What happens when this property is not present (even if blank) for other build types? Want to make sure we wont crash the release builds when this file is parsed.
This will be blank in that case, and I tested Instabug will log invalid appID, but won't crash. But defiantly will make sure on production RC builds.
I though we already replaced to `makeViewController` from `newViewController`
I've just checked sources and I see that OneApp has 109 occurrences of using old name - `newViewController` , at the same time this is not in scope of the fix and was added to diff only because I changed `if` to `guard`.
can we `first...where` instead?
"this code is not about getting one (first) view controller, but about getting an array of all other view controllers, I can replace this with 
```swift
guard var vcs = navigationController?.viewControllers, 
      let lastVc = vcs.popLast(), 
      lastVc is STZWaveReplaceViewController else {
    return
}
let zWaveSuccessViewController = STZWaveSuccessViewController.newViewController()
zWaveSuccessViewController.screenType = .replaceZWave
vcs.append(zWaveSuccessViewController)
navigationController?.setViewControllers(vcs, animated: true)
```

at the same time actually this code is not related to problem which I wanted to fix, I just replaced `if` with a `guard`."
ah.. I might be then confused w/ the variable name.
you can make startWithCompleted if you are ignoring result
why we need defer here?
how about moving to viewDidLoad?

"if same the card type, I think it doesn't need the animation

additionally, if same the card type, it is unnecessary that change to new view (I think it is enough that call the configure function of exist view)

"there are two animation type

1. message change (I think the card type change)
- [SE10.X]SmartThings_VI_LandingPage_SummaryMessageChange.mp4
2. message dismiss (I think the case where the card type change from the vdfService alert to the vdfService normal)
- [SE10.X]SmartThings_VI_LandingPage_SummaryMessageDismiss.mp4"
`migrationInteractor` is already initialized in above
the dismiss animation should be appeared in case of the location summary card type is changed from vdfService alert to  not alert (vdfService normal, device status, location, welcome, etc)
I think this seems to same with isAnimating
In case of multiple request in a short period of time it is required, so that same item (first animation item) is not processed.

@mahapmanoj Is it safe for me to remove these commented out lines? We discussed this in Slack and it sounds like this code is broken and should be replaced.
yep, safe to delete.
has this API argument changed from `locationId` to `[locationId]`?
Something definitely went wrong with your rebase.  This should not be in SK's headers anymore after the MR that went into SK master last week.
Yeah I've updated my SmartKit MR so this is no longer included outside of the test target. I'll update this accordingly once I've got `Device.Status` included in that MR.
Do we want to bail out here if this condition isn't met? Might be good to at least have some logging so we have an indication of why it's bailing out if this comes up as a bug.
Not sure what we would do instead of bailing here. It's not possible to set `completedSetup` on a non-dth device. I can add a log statement though.
Yeah its minor... only thinking of a situation where a bug could come in and we'd have no trace on what the behavior is without the log statement.
Looks like the project picked up an unintentional change here.

Kindly use isRTL() funnction of CLAppEngine
"CLEngine and UIApplication are both singleton classes and isRTL() does same checking.
do we require this method?"
Yes, isRTL is common function which has `UIApplication.shared.userInterfaceLayoutDirection == .rightToLeft condition . so instead of writing this condition everywhere , isRTL() function can be used.
This issue is already fixed so revert this change.
is it the dispatch queue you mentioned in "Keep both callback under one DispatchQueue"?
No, This is global queue. The queue in question is named: `privateQueue`, used in `cloudSignInResult` API
Is there any difference between if we call setIotivitySignInStatus(...) before or after keepAliveWorker.end()?
`setIotivitySignInStatus` API changes cloud sign in status, dispatch notification center message where as `keepAliveWorker.end()` is only ends keep alive ping

What's the reason for changing this from a `let` to a `var`?
What's the reason for having `AccountManager` hold a reference to the access token?
"`AuthenticationFacade` will be renamed to `AuthenticationTokenManager` once it is no longer acting as a facade. At that point, it's responsibility will be to be the single source of truth for maintaining the access token and keeping it up to date. We shouldn't be adding responsibilities, like `AuthenticationProvider` or `UserProfileProvider` to this class. 

Since all the methods in these two extensions just call into the `AccountManager`, it probably makes more sense to move these protocol conformances to that class instead."
We should not be passing a concrete instance of `AccountManager` into this initializer.
Since `AuthenticationFacade` should not be conforming to these protocols, we should move these declarations elsewhere.
Same comment as above. We should move this elsewhere.
What's the reason for adding this property to `AccountManager`? `AuthenticationFacade` should be the single-source-of-truth for the users access token. If we _must_ use an instance of `CloudKeychain` to store the access token, the `AuthenticationFacade` should create the instance and it should be private to the `AuthenticationFacade`.
`CloudKeychain` values shouldn't be accessed from anywhere else other than `AccountManager`, as `AccountManager` is responsible for detail implementation. `AuthenticationFacade` will get all required information from `AccountManager` (its interfaces). For this case, `TokenProvider`
In this case it seems that we have a disagreement about architecture and responsibilities.  Our plan for a long time now has been to move responsibility for managing the access token into `AuthenticationFacade` (which will eventually be renamed to `AuthenticationTokenManager`).  It is currently only a facade which delegates that responsibility but we should be refactoring towards the goal of moving all responsibility for token management into that.
"Long time goal is to provide ""single-source-of-truth"" with better test coverage, and it wont happen without eliminating/hiding direct dependencies of `CloudAccountManager`, `CloudSignInHelper`, `SAHelper`. 
I think `AccountManager` here is your `AuthenticationTokenManager` isn't it? Please check `AccountManager` conformed protocols (API's)"
"@muntasir please refer to this document: https://smartthings.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CAS/pages/499418486/SRBD+s+plan+for+applying+refactored+Auth+modules

@tjohnson Thats correct, current `AccountManager` is the `AccountAPICoordinator` mentioned in the design, it will manage everything related to account module: authentication, token management, cloud connection, auth code related API's, SCClient init-deint

But,

**How this is possible???** Can you share your plan/protocol to handle all auth related data?

If ~~`AccountAPICoordinator`~~/`AccountManager` is in charge of detail Authentication, it should store/delete auth related data. `AuthenticationFacade` can use that data & provide general interface to application/ST & ensure single source of truth.

**What about connect/disconnect API's?**"
"@tjohnson 
Again, this MR is a intermediate step towards refactoring Account Module. Goal of this MR is to encapsulate CloudAccountManager, SAHelper, CloudSignInHelper usage and there will be few more MR's down the line. Without encapsulating those, we c"
@muntasir `AccountManager` should be in charge of the initial authentication / token acquisition and possibly the _basic network request_ performed to refresh the token.  It should not be in charge of storing the token or driving the token refresh process
"> If you have specific questions about how to implement parts of `AccountManager` without storing the token internally we will be happy to help work through those issues and find solutions.  If you can articulate specific reasons _why_ you are reluctant to give up ownership and management of the token that would be helpful.

I could have ask you the same question! As we are undertaking account module responsibility at low level, I don't see any good reason why (& **how**) persistency of tokens/data should be moved to upper layer. I would like to know, why and how this will be done.

@k.hassan"
"@Muntasir, when you were here in HQ we reached in that consensus. It is a decision issue.
@tjohnson Would you please answer how persistency of tokens will be maintained in upper layer (Managed by SmartThings team) as Mr. Muntasir asked. "
"@k.hassan @muntasir

@k.hassan that isnâ€™t quite correct.  We intend for AuthebticationFacade to own all management of the token including keychain persistence.  @tjohnson just hasnâ€™t finished the refactoring yet.
"> We intend for AuthebticationFacade to own all management of the token including keychain persistence.

> This has been outlined extensively in the confluence document (from above) that HQ agreed upon.

I don't find any such document/design which says how this will be done. If upper layer is in-charge of persistency, there should be well designed interface to do so, all management related to connection will be moved to upper layer and `AccountManager` will be a simple API implementation."
"The documentation @tjohnson provided clearly states that AuthenticationFacade will own and manage the token.  It may not have been 100% explicit but we have always intended for that to include keychain persistence.  The diagram he provided explains how we intend for the various modules to communicate.  If any part of that is not clear please let us know and we will be happy to elaborate further.

I donâ€™t know the details of everything you are doing, but based on the limited knowledge I have, moving connection management up and making AccountManager a simple API implementation sounds like a good separation of responsibilities."
"> The documentation @tjohnson provided clearly states that AuthenticationFacade will own and manage the token.

I understand that is stated, though my question is un-answered there. My question is how? Please check the comments there."
"> My question is how?

I need your question to be more specific in order to provide an acceptable answer? Is your concern related to this comment you made in the confluence document?

> access & refresh token is not the only thing that currently managed (persist) by account module. There are bunch of data related to sign in to handle

Are you asking how SmartThings plans to persist the rest of the data that is not related to access token/refresh token? I.e. `authServerUrl`, `apiServerUrl`, `serverCertificateData`, etc.?"
What's the reason for this signal? This class should just provide the methods for obtaining/refreshing the access token. It shouldn't include any signals for when the token changes. That's the responsibility of `AuthenticationFacade`.
Please tell me how `AuthenticationFacade` will be able to provide signal for token change?
`AuthenticationFacade` conforms to `AccessTokenProvider`.  You should use that API in code that requires use of the access token.  However, we are seeking to eliminate the need to use the access token as much as possible.  It should be extremely rare to require direct use of the access token.
"Let me clarify our intent of this change,
1. Remove all direct dependencies of `CloudAccountManager`, `CloudSignInHelper`, `SAHelper`
2. Define all account related API's/properties in `AccountManager` and expose them in `ApplicationCoordinator` through protocols
3. Finally, implement new account API's with better unit test coverage and get rid of `CloudAccountManager`, `CloudSignInHelper`, `SAHelper`.

This is the very first change (of many more in upcoming weeks) of task-1, where we aggregate all API's under `AccountManager`."
@anandabits `AccessTokenProvider` protocol, only provides access/refresh token and uses `.cloudAccessStatusChanged` notification to provide token/authentication state change signal. We want to remove those uses. Thats why we are not using that protocol
@muntasir `AuthenticationFacade` is only temporarily using `.cloudAccessStatusChanged`, once `AuthenticationFacade` is the true single-source-of-truth, we will be able to remove the reliance on `.cloudAccessStatusChanged`.

Returning `false` would stop the user from adding the device which would be unwanted in case someone changed how `setupAppData` was handled without being aware of this. This MR is adding a `EasySetupSelectLocationViewControllerLocationValidationDelegate` which has the purpose of allowing the delegate to decide if the location is valid for adding a device to or not. The delegate is not a requirement, it can be nil and the pairing functionality will work just as it did before this MR.

"What if group list is nil or empty?

this logic is swapping out family group with the one that comes first. Meaning, it would be breaking the order of the groups brought from server. I'd suggest that you simply remove the family group and insert it at index 0 to keep that order.

remove the empty space
remove the empty spaces
please remove the empty spaces
It's better to rename the method to '...memberSelectionView'
"Should this string be hard coded?

use localised strings."
should a delegate be set here. This method will be called multiple times.
please make an if-else ladder as the current implementation will go through all the statements even after the deviceType is found earlier.
Also move to separate method like 'getDeviceIcon' or 'setupDeviceIcon'
Better to rename this method to memberPicker. and Change the delegate to MemberPickerDelegate.
check if this is intentional or not.
change this to selection map for contacts/friends...
what does 'sc' stands for.
if this is being used for determining the view type, instead of using boolean use ViewType enum.
"this is to differentiate between users election view and device selection view. 
ViewType is used to detect view  controllers."
We are using SocialColors class. Use from there. if it is for removing the separator only for this view, then no need.
capitalize V
I think apple uses naming like didSelectePeople/Device.
please update the name to a more appropriate one.
add what? Please provide more intuitive name.
make the self instance weak.
SESSDk doesn't know about views, move to app side.
please follow consistent convention of prefix "IDS"
please follow consistent convention of prefix "Image"

It was not available in previous patch."
remove if Codable is not necessary
separate the names.
please adda . NOTE why 2 is hardcoded so tat the purpose is better understood
please rename this to reflect the purpose more. suggestion: "sectionHeaderTitle"
no need to assign to new variable.
please try to avoid force unwrapping
This change is still same as previous comment.
"didTapSegmentControl" seems more appropriate.
didSelectPeople
didSelectDevice
Use SocialColors.
"keep gesture recogniser as member variable.
It will create multiple instances and won't be possible to remove it."
this function doesn't need to be called multiple times. Back button won't change. So prepare once and assign to leftBarButton when necessary.
either rename to defaultBackButtonImage or rename the rest without Image suffix
add IDS prefix to this and all the following that lacks it
Please remove this. It is unnecessary
See above comment
rename to memberSelectionview
rename to showMemberSelectionView
why is error optional in failure block? Please log error even if error is nil to notify of failure
please move guard let to the top of the function
rename to backBtnTapGestureRecognizer
remove.
fix formatting here
no need to write additional init function. Assign default values to the other one
Is there any benefit in having tagged user array nullable? If not make it mandatory and assign empty list [ ] as its default value
It should not be mandatory as post can be created without any tagged users

Fixed Merge conflict and removed remaining deinit functions"
Better use class name instead of hard coding.
Deinit fuction is to be removed and given in another commit
please check is it necessary or not
self is not mandatory here and IDE's color coding would suffice to indicate if it is a member variable or a function variable. However, this format has been used in all APIs that has the definition of a handleSuccessResponse(data: Data) function as this would adds further to readability at the expense of increased verbosity. As such this refactoring, if necessary, would be too extensive and out of the scope of this commit.
check all of this "self"
check previous comment
Is it guaranteed to always return non-nil?
I think we can remove this file now.
Before removing we have to check it further
Instead of using DispatchQueue let's use Background Task handler. check with Rakeeb.
Try to pass image view and move the function to Util class. Reduce duplicated codes.
Similar function has been used in many other places. That's why it will be done in next CL.
Formatting not correct.
"This function seems duplicated. Move to Util class.

Also better rename it to fetchProfileImage(fromUrl:withHash:forImageView)"
rename - done
better to break the line for readability.
This closure should be set as completionTask of ThreadWorker.
this method should not be here, View is directly accessing ImageCacheStorage rather FeedbackManager should communicate with ImageCacheStorage.
"> this method should not be here, View is directly accessing

Good job, Marjan.."
Same comment applies here. Closure should be set as completionTask
Please look at the previous comment about this method.
it should be createdTime I think.
Modify in image util as per discussion to remove duplicate codes.
"1. CoreData already support update for Comment entity.
2. I believe we need to update the imageHash only if the imageHash is nil."
it will be done in the next refactoring of feed
"Is this ""Like"" object passed by reference?
if not, updating the imageHash here will have no effect. Please check."
Check My previous comment on updating the imageHash in Views. Please check and confirm.
Nothing is being done here. Remove if unnecessary.
Add logs in validation blocks.
add comment for labels.
This should be timeline.

if error exists, imageHash will be nil and we do not need to assign nil to the optional post.postOwnerImageHash var. I think it should be inside an else block.
majority of this function is reusable. Either use a private function for common code or use boolean to indicate execution nature
please use ImageCompressionQuality.fullSize.rawValue

We are supposed to use images from SocialImages class.
Image to data? or Data to image?
"function name says insertMember. But this function is doing something else.

"profile name class has a profile type and account type. 
Shouldn't profile class contain these variable?"
AccountType contains familyName, gienName??
This was given by server so I kept it as is
ProfileTypeContains NAMES!!
Is it mandatory field? If so, add validation.
Group Id is already non optional. So nil cannot be assigned.
Keep init methods at the top, after variables
"Instead of database, use 'forceDataFromServer' check 'requestFeedbackCounts' method in contact profile manager.
We may change databases, list may come from files, or other storages. So, app doesn't need to specify that."

"We don't need the ImageCacheDelegate  to be global.

We may need to process several several ImageCache process asynchronously, and set different callback for each one.

If we use a single delegate for all the ImageCache processing in this class. one call beak will get replaced by other and we will not get the desired output.

Please change it."
replace with underscore if not used inside the block.
"When we received the liker info from the server, Did we get the liker profile image hash? or just the URL?

If we don't receive and update the liker profile image hash before, we should update this in the callback."
The liker profile object can be sent as parameter rather imageHash and url.
I think this is more generic and easy to understand
"break parameters to new line for better readability:
ImageCacheStorage.sharedInstance.retrieveImage(imageHash: imageHash,         imageUrl: imageUrl,
withDelegate: profileImageCacheDelegate,
 cacheNamespace: .profile)"

"1. Since there is no use of the imageCacheDelegate here other than to pass it to ""fetchProfileImage()"" function, I'd recommend to declare and initialize it in the ""fetchProfileImage()"" function.

2. Also, Just ""imageCacheDelegate"" or ""cacheDelegate"" is enough as the delegate name."
I'd recommend to check if the image is retrieved from the cache. If it's download from the server, in that case only update the imageHash and also update the CoreData.
Currently we are not saving like data in CoreData, that's why we can't update profile image hash.
why is this outside of dispatch queue? If there are no UI errors related to layout updates I think it will be best to write it just after where the image is being set for easier debugging.

After discussing with you, as per you suggestion, the functions are kept as they are.
"This attribute is not fetched from the server response, Rather calculated locally after the object is fetched from the server.

I do not think we need Coding key for this one. Please check."
"Group image exp. time is not decoded from server data.

Please check."
Move this calculation in the Group decoder init function. In such way you'll have better control and won't need to implement this anywhere else.
better to add "NOTE" in comment.
We don't need to run another "For loop". Just move this assignment in the "buildRespondedGroupList()".
Since the URL is not assigned we don't need to initialize the exp. time here.

"Making ""MyProfile"" optional here will create an uncertainty in the viewControllers that this value could be nil.

MyProfile is such an object in this project that a user can not perform any action without a valid ""MyProfile"" object.

So our main objective of this patch is to ensure all the modules/ViewControllers that, MyProfile is already fetched and stored in the CoreData and whenever they request the myProfile object, they will receive a validated object in return. So that each ViewController will not require to implement the validation check each time they access the ""myProfile"" object.

Please do not make the ""MyProfile"" parameter optional in the callback signature. But change in the required classes/functions to ensure a valid return."
I'd recommend to follow the error log style we followed in the project.

please remove the extra newline
"In SignIn Success we should not fetch the myProfileInfo from the CoreData. Because
    1. User may login using different Id. in such case fetching MyProfile info from CoreData might show the previous Profile info.

    2. More importantly, on Sign out success we must delete the MyProfile data from CoreData, So it will return empty list right after Sign-in success.

We should directly fetch the MyProfileInfo for the first time right after Sign-In"
Instead of using constant, I'd recommend to use the UIView "reuseId".
Fetching Profile image should also be done in "getMyProfileFromServer()" right after the MyProfileInfo is fetched for the first time.
"Redundant return statement.

Since "myProfile" object is not used here, You can replace it with "_" to avoid any static analysis warning.

    view.presenter = presenter
    presenter.view = view
    presenter.interactor = interactor

This constant has no use. Please remove.
I'd recommend not to assign the image data in the "myProfile.profilePic" as we'll gradually remove any image data from all the entities.
"""requestMyProfile()""  will be frequently called from different module. We should try to make the computation of this function as lite as possible. Please check below suggestion...

    - Do not fetch the profile image here. Nor perform image cacheing. Fetch and cache the profile image on first login.

    - Just perform a check if myProfile is already retrieved from CoreData first.
        -> If it's already retrieved just execute the callback.
        -> And if not, retrieve the MyProfile info from the CoreData, populate the global variable and then execute the call back."
Remove any Image data attribute from the MyProfile entity in a later patch. Instead we will will utilize the image cacheing module.
should be "is nil"
correct spelling mistake here
add [weak self]
add debug log at here
according to static analyzer, delegate should be weak. If making it weak generates issue, you may make it local in the function where it is used.
Please add a debug note here notifying if either image hash or data is nil. Otherwise will be hard to debug later
Add the fourth in comment please (// didRe...., error, data, something)
save value somewhere common
this is not from server but rather it was computed from image itself.
add space here
assign in a common place
make localizeable
"Please check if this is necessary.
According to my analysis, if you declare the case, this is not required.

"1. Do we need the ""imagedata"" anymore? if not, better replace it with ""_"" to avoid any SA warning.

2. Also update the callback signature in the comment."
"1. imageData is being used in the function, can't be removed
2. done"
We already passing the image hash in the callback. Generating the hash again from the image again is redundant. Please check.
Singular/Plural condition should be handled.
"We can write the logic as below....
===================================================
 if imageHash == nil {
     SemsLog.debug(message: ""Image hash found nil. Computing hash from server fetched data"")
     imageHash = fetchedData.sha256
 }

 cache.storeImageData(toDisk: fetchedData, forKey: imageHash)
 delegate?.taskCompletionAction(didRetrieveFromCache: false, error: nil, data: fetchedData, cacheKey: imageHash)
===================================================

Here an extra variable ""cacheKey"" will not require."
imageHash is a parameter and therefore a let variable which is immutable. That's why this approach was used.
Either provide the error in log or replace it with underscore if not used inside the block.
Follow the error log style we followed in the project.
"I think the following snippet would be better, please check and if you agree then update:

added a todo comment.
Why are these flags necessary when device and member list length checking can serve the same purpose? This flag manipulation is getting complicated throughout this humongous class
These variables with observables are suggested to be moved to the bottom of all the variable declarations at the beginning of the class
observation is not required anymore as the flags are removed.
Since SocialError has method to get message for specific error code, can it be used to print the errors?
Error code is used to conceal the error details to the users. Since this is a debug level log, this will not be a part of public release and we don't have to be concern about the information encapsulation or Privacy issue
please check if required.

This function is too big. break it down to several functions based on the action performed.

swift default is forced when incorporated with switch statement. it is necessary
Switch case must be exhaustive and so default case must be given
is it proper way to set contentMode here? please discuss this.
shouldn't this error mandatory?
"according to UX invited devices should be labeled as ""Added""
create a new outlet for added devices."
"remove the border here.
New checkbox is added into image assets that doesn't require border."

follow the proper error printing format
make this localizable.
make this localizable too
I'd recommend to follow the naming convention defined in SocialConstants.swift
"groupMemberSelectionView" would be better
Check above comment
If viewType is no longer used, remove it.
"DO NOT USE ANY INAPPROPRIATE COMMENT IN THE CODE.

PLEASE CHANGE."
Add a separate function to enable/disable add member button.
Use SocialImages API for menu_button image
Use SocialImages API for profile_icon image
change this to invitedLabel
"Maintain Consistency in the variable name.

I'd recommend as
    - isInvitedView
    - isMemberView
    - isDeviceView"
Keep this variable private and write an internal function to set all the cell's parameter and it's logic in this class.
Use SocialImages API for this
add a NOTE/FIXME here . since currently invite/add call for device will always result in a failure block.
In the current Server doc, Is ProfileId and guid different?
yes profile id and guid is same but in app it still uses did
change this to invitedDevices.append(contentsOf: selectedDevices)
"What should be the title for memberView?
You should add the else condition.
For better readability, you should add the else condition and post a note comment as 

// NOTE: Implement logic for memberView.
OR
// NOTE: No Modification is required for memberView"
remove these commented block
"What to Fix?
Please mention."
nothing to fix
"Write a configureCell() function with required input param in GroupMemberSelectionTableViewCell. and configure all this in that function.

You may break it down in several private function there."
"Write a setCellSelection() function with required input param in GroupMemberSelectionTableViewCell. and configure all this in that function.

You may break it down in several private function there."
not needed. remove this too.
Remove this trailing space
"setMemberListStackState(to:)" seems better to me.
"Why you are using nil coalescing? selectedGroup is not a optional member.

Please check."
Kindly break it down is several line (like line - 137) for better readability.
"If we are using return statement,  do we need to use else-if condition?
Please check."
"Why are we reloading the table view?
OnInvitationSuccess member list will not update. It'll update only when the invited member accept the invitation.

Please check."
This is to show Invited Label on success
Please check above comment. Similar concept applicable here too.
This resets selected members
we can use "selectedDevices.count". No need to use an extra variable
Since this is same for all conditions, keep it outside of the if-else loop.
Use a class constant
Move this function to GroupMemberSelectionTableViewCell class.
Move all of this function to GroupMemberSelectionTableViewCell class
This functions require UIViews not available in cell class
"Should we use empty string? In my opinion using profileId would be better rather than the empty string.
Please check and explain."
"""selectedGroup"" is not a optional member.
Please check and change all occurrences."
Instead of using three boolean, use a single variable of ViewType enum
"This function will not be called for device view. So we can use the fetchImage function with the container as below...

fetchImage(imageHash: contact.profilePicHash,
                                 fromUrl: contact.profilePicHash,
                                 cacheNameSpace: .profile,
                                 to container: self.profileImageView)"
"Should we use empty string? in my Opinion using profileId would be better.

Please check all occurrences."
shouldn't it checkBoxSelectedImage??
"membersCount is retrieved from the server response when the Group details are fetched.

We should not update this in memberListFetcheSuccess().

In fact in the below patch it was removed.

https://gerrit.sw.sec.samsung.net/open/#/c/326476/5/SocialApp/SocialApp/Group/View/GroupFeedViewController.swift

Please check."
If you do not set "false" to the "setCircular" parameter of fetchImage function, It'll set the image to circular by default. Hence this line of code is redundant.
"Please check if this comment is required anymore.
If not kindly remove it."
"Please check if we should keep ""profileId"" for nil coalescing operation.
I think that would be better than the empty string."
"Can we write this as below....

if viewType == .groupCreateView && groupType != .general {
        activateNextButton()
} else {
        activateInviteButton()
}

Please check."
Remove empty line
"Instead of calling the function twice, I'd recommend to store the profile in a local temp variable and access the guId/profileId from that.

let tempProfile = getProfile(forIndex: indexPath.row)
deselectedItem = tempProfile.guid ?? tempProfile.profileId"
Also save this member list with the api available in GroupManager.
Changed in memberPicker delegate.
"members are already filtered in GroupInteractor calss and providing you the members and pending members separately.
Filtering here the member list again is redundant."
"rightBarButtonItem's enable state is toggled several time here.
Better to do it in a function instead of writing this logic multiple times.

Modify that in a later patch."
Although the code block executed is same, the logic is different in different cases
Update this button from updatePostButtonStatus() method
"DB Query/Network Call/ other heavy tasks shouldn't be in the constructor/init methods. This will block the object creation.

Better move it to the instance creation of sharedInstance.

Also check for other best practices."
Returning empty object might cause inconsistency.
please check if the condition is correct.
follow if else code structure convention
Managers should not access each other. I't may create circular dependency.
add callback label.
"Why we are not utilizing the ""getDeviceIcon()"" function?
Please modify and use that function."
Make it non-optional and initialize it with empty array in init.
"getFamilyDeviceList()" seems better.
"Modify this function to return the device list only. It should not execute any call back.

You can perform the callback execution in the ""getDeviceList()"" function."
Use code style formatter to keep style formatting consistent throughout the code base.
"getMemberDevicesPost()" seems better to me.
"This call should not reach the SDK side every time we need to get the device list unless there is a change in the device list or we are fetching the device list for the first time.

Better to have some logic here to prevent the function call to reach the SDK side.

At least put a TODO comment for now."
"""setMemberDevices(with deviceList: [Device])""
or 
""setFamilyMemberDevices(with deviceList: [Device])""
seems better to me"
Kindly check above comments.
only nil check for the selected device is not sufficient. We should also check if the device list is empty too. This will prevent the unnecessary function call if there is no device selected as member.
Samsung Smart "refrigerator" is known as family hub. Please check if you added "familyhub" knowingly
refrigerator is removed.
"Should we generate dummyDeviceList every time getDeviceList() function is called?

Please check."
I think this change will not be added in this CL
please follow the proper way by adding "// (error)"....
"Please rewrite as follows for better readability:

feed.filter { 
    feedElem in deviceList.contains { 
        feedElem.postOwnerId == $0.deviceId || 
            (feedElem.postType != .deviceEvent && 
             feedElem.postType != .reminder && 
             feedElem.postType != .shoppingList) 
        } 
    } // NOTE: keeps posts by member devices and all posts created by non-device members"
better to use Enum for better readability
I think feedElement or feedItem would be better readable
use formatter
Use style formatter
"Should be memberDevices or memberDeviceList.
Please check."
Better to execute the successBlock and failureblock here instead of passing it to the SDK side.
Check my Previous comment
"This function is used several times.
Better to write this function in CommonUtils class"
"1. Rename this to memberDevices
2. SDK Manager should not cache the member devicelist."
Dummu list should not get generated every time.
Better to name as removeAllMemberDevices()
Move it to ImageUtils
"Patch Set 1:

For the 1x images, We do not need the ""@1x"" prefix in the file name.
Kindly change that."
I think it should be "parse"
Shouldn't we avoid force unwrapping here?
"We are gradually removing the force unwrapping in this class. In this patch only Timeline Item is refactored.

We'll refactor the convertToLike() and convertToMyInfo() in later patch.
Please check the TODO comment on the top of those function."
I think it would be "Failed to fetch creation Time."
please rename to creationTime.
"This variable is named according to the server response key. I prefer to keep as it is.

Thank you for the concern."
please rename to "albumImageHashes"
please discuss with rakeeb vai if this one needs to be compared in "isEqual" function.
please add them in isEqual function.
add this one in "isEqual" function.
Please remove this trailing space
"This is done is several cases. 
    - ContactProfileManager -> updateMyProfileToCoreData() line: 396.
    - ContactProfilePresenter -> requestMyProfile()

any better suggestion?"
